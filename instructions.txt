    - python manage.py sqlmigrate poll_app 0001
    - python manage.py migrate
    - you can add new record to models using a shell inside the Django:
        python manage shell => this deploy a interactive command:
        >>> from poll_app.models import Question, Choice
        >>> Question.objects.all() database doesn't  have any record yet
        >>> from django.utils import timezone
        >>> from django.utils import timezone
        >>> q1 = Question(question_text="What is your favorite programming language?", published_date=timezone.now())

        datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 16, 20, 46, 38, 16808, tzinfo=<UTC>)
        >>>q.save()
        >>> q = Question.objects.all()[0]
        >>> q.published_recently()
